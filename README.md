# Germany RAG Assistant 🇩🇪

A production-grade **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** system that answers questions about German residence and work regulations using **grounded official documents**, with citations and evaluation.

This project focuses on **reliable, evidence-based AI** rather than generic chatbots, and demonstrates how to reduce hallucinations in real-world GenAI systems.
